## Profile

I am a creative person with a great passion for learning new things. My interests ranging from computers, economy, psychology, painting, guitar, piano, electronics, hydraulics,..and a whole lot more. My main goal is having a good life while I am here, and I strive to have it that way. To make that possible I like to have a good relation to the people around me, and keep a focus on the things that bring us together, and forward, not the minor details that put os on a path in the opposite direction.

I started with programming at the age of 11 with languages like Basic, Pascal, and Assembler.
My first job was within an OPS environment, so the programming became a thing I did when I needed a script to parse data, or a tool for some task. I decided to do something about just that in 2017.
I quit my job after 20+ years working with servers/network/security, and decided to start a full time study within the Go programming language.
