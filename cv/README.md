## Summary

A skilled professional with a passion for knowledge and a genuine interest in various fields such as programming, networks, security, Linux, philosophy, music, electronics, farming, and more. In 2017 I decided to change focus from infrastructure to Go development. My multidisciplinary background often provides me with the ability to handle challenges from diverse angles, making me an effective contributor to successful product and business development and adept at solving problems within projects or independently.

## Professional Experience

Been working with Data centers, Network, Security, Servers, and Monitoring since 1997, and made the switch to Development in 2017. Are now often found somwhere inbetween the code and the infrastructure :)

I've chosen to focus on Go as my primary language, but do also good understanding of other languages like Python, Bash, JavaScript.
