## Summary

A creative technophile with a great passion for learning new things. My interests ranging from Programming, IT, Psychology, Economy, Art, Guitar, Piano, Electronics, Hydraulics, Farming..and more.
In 2017 I decided to add Go Development to that list.

My broad experience often helps me see problem scenarios and new solutions as a whole. This have made me  build good products with the customer in mind, and helped solving complex problems within project and team work.

I first started programming in Pascal about 3 decades ago, but things happened and my main work became networks and servers, where programming was something I continued to do, but occasionally. In 2017 I decided to switch that around, and do development as the main thing.

## Professional Experience

Been working with Data centers, Network, Security, Servers, and Monitoring since 1997, and made the switch to fulltime Development in 2017.

Building Edge Cloud solutions from the ground and up.
